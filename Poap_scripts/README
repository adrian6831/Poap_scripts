This repo contains a set of scripts helping configuring POAP. It provides a GUI 
implemented by tkinter to setup dhcp servers and POAP nexus scripts. It includes
following scripts:

    Handler/prime.py: the master script that create a GUI to receive configuration 
        parameters, parse them into bash arguments, and run following bash scripts with 
        them. If any script below is missing, this script will stop working.
    Poap_nexus_scripts/poap.py: a templete POAP nexus script. It will not be executed
        by prime.py but uploaded to switches. This script was originally pulled from 
        git repo https://github.com/datacenter/nexus9000.git under 
        nexus9000/nx-os/poap/poap.py. I made a little modification, adding options
        "enable_upgrade" and "skip_single_image_check". 
    DHCP_add_host.sh: adding a host block with POAP configuration to dhcpd.conf 
        (assuming under /etc/dhcp/) enabling a switch with the specific
        dhcp-client-identifier/switch-identifier to be setup with POAP.
    DHCP_add_subnet.sh: adding a subnet block with POAP configuration to dhcpd.conf
        (assuming under /etc/dhcp/) enabling switches receiving ip from the pool
        within this block to be setup with POAP.
    DHCP_delete_host.sh: removing a host block from dhcpd.conf, no matter it 
        contains POAP configuration or not.
    DHCP_delete_subnet.sh: removing a subnet block from dhcpd.conf, no matter it 
        contains POAP configuration or not.
    DHCP_init.sh: init dhcpd.conf for POAP process. It will overwrite the original
        dhcpd.conf but also warn users before doing so. Users may decide whether to 
        proceed or not.
    DHCP_reset.sh: straightly reset dhcpd.conf to the intial status. It has the same 
        effect as running DHCP_init.sh and choose "yes" when asked whether overrite 
        the original dhcpd.conf. 
    Poap_script_config.sh: configure a POAP nexus script with POAP_nexus_scripts/poap.py
        as templete. It will create a copy of poap.py and modify that copy with 
        parameters specified. It will not work if POAP_nexus_scripts/poap.py is missing. 

All shell scripts (ending with .sh) but Poap_script_config have helping functions and 
sufficient error catching mechanism to be run independently. So if you just want to 
delete a host block, you may just run DHCP_delete_host.sh with parameters required.

Current limitations:
    1. prime.py find other scripts with relative paths hardcoded. If structure of this 
    directory is changed or some scripts are moved to different locations, you need 
    to change those relative paths prime.py.
    2. Some shell scripts uses command "sed", which acts very differently in GNU
    and BSD/OS. I wrote those scripts in Ubuntu Desktop so those "sed" are in 
    GNU syntax. If you want to run them on BSD/OS, you'll need some changes.
